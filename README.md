Hello. 
My name is Rohan. I am starting my software development/coding journey, and have created this github account for the same. 
Here, I will be charting my progress with regular updates, and will be uploading project files and sharing my thoughts. 

I am currently 23 years old, in my final year. Yes, I'm starting this learning expedition a bit late, due to some reasons, but it's okay. I am starting it now! 

Cheers!
